# Piggus

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Local Building

For Windows using WLS:
```bash
npm install
```
Having Sentry working with the local build can be an issue.
```bash
export SENTRY_ALLOW_FAILURE=true
```
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production --local
```
